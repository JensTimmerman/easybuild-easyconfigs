 now can write utilities and extensions in Python instead of C. This package was developed to replace xpbsmon by an
 ASCII version named pbsmon. PBSQuery is also included in this package. This is a Python module built on top of the pbs
 Python module to simplify querying the batch server. There are a lot of examples included in the source package.
